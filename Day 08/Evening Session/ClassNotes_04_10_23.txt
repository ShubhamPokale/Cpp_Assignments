1. int n1, n2, sum, sub, mul;

void calculate(n1,n2,ref of sum, sub and mul)

    using references make changes into sum, sub and mul variables.

print results into main function

2. int calculate(int, int, int choice)

   choice = 1 return sum
            2 return sub
            3 return mul

  
3. use function pointer to put appr address of function, based on choice
    call function using function pointer
